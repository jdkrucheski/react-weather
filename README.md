This is a simple application that use [Openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get the weather forecast of five predefined cities.

## Demo

[Link to demo](https://weather.jonathankrucheski.xyz/).

## Run in local environment

Only clone this repository, rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`, open a terminal in the container folder and run the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

Or if you prefer npm:

```
npm  install
npm run dev
```

For didactic reasons, the file .env.example includes the API KEY of the service of Openweathermap. But this is not a good practice. If you want use this application, get your own API KEY [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).
