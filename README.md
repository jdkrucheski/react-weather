## Demo

[Link to demo](https://weather.jonathankrucheski.xyz/).

## Run in local environment

Only clone this repository, rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`, open a terminal in the container folder and run the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

Or if you prefer npm:

```
npm  install
npm run dev
```

For didactic reasons, the file .env.example include the API KEY of the service of Openweathermap. But this is not a goot practice. If you whatn use this aplication, get your own API KEY [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).
